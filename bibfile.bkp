  abstract  = {We present a thermal lattice Bhatnager-Gross-Krook ($BGK$) model in $D$-dimensional space for the numerical simulation of Quid dynamics. This model uses a higher-order velocity expansion for Maxwellian-type equilibrium distribution. In the meantime, the lattice symmetry has been upgraded to ensure isotropy for the sixth-rank velocity-moment tensor. These manipulations lead to macroscopic equations without the nonlinear deviations, from which conventional thermal or nonthermal lattice $BGK$ models suffered. We demonstrate the improvements by conducting classical Chapman-Enskog analysis and by the numerical calculation of the structure of the shock wave front and the decaying rate of the kinetic energy in the shear wave Bow. Parameters in the velocity expansion are explicitly given for example models in one, two, and three dimensions. The transport coeRcients of the modeled one-dimensional ($1D$) and $2D$ Huids are numerically measured as well.},

  review    = {Read on Sun, 2016-03-13. Written on a time in which lattice Boltzmann methods, LBM, were mainly, if not only, derived from lattice gas automata, LGA, the article presents the derivation of the lattice-Boltzmann equation, LBE, directly from the continuous Boltzmann equation with the approximation of linearization of the collision operator and the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook, BGK, approximation with a single relaxation time. The article sheds light on the reasons why the method had not enjoyed success in simulating thermohydrodynamic systems before, refs [19--22], and afirms that the SRT BGK approximation is ``sufficient for the purpose of studying hydrodynamics of simple fluids''. It provides a clear, accessible, step-by-step presentation of the discretization of the Boltzmann equation, covering the following requirements: continuous Boltzmann equation without body/external-force term and velocity moments of the single-particle PDF, Section II; discretization in time, Section II-a, calculation of hydrodynamic moments from the discretized data, Section II-b; derivation of the LBE and its EDF, along with its ingredients, Section III; low-Mach number approximation of the EDF, Section III-a; discretization of phase space, Section III-b. In Section IV, some well-known, low order LBE models, such as the D2Q6, D2Q7, D2Q9, and D3Q27, are derived. Some unknown methods are cited, such as the Radau-Gauss numerical integration formula from ref. [35], after which the reading becomes way less clear. The following discussion is confused, as a so-called gas ``speed of light'' and ``speed of sound'' are mentioned, as well as the weights $w_a$ are simply presented, without further explanation. There are $W_a$ and $w_a$ weights in the text. Excellent material to base a presentation of up the the LBE equation, without applying it to a particular lattice configuration. This paper confirms that the integral of vector d\xi expands into multiple (=# of dimensions) integrals of velocity direction and magnitude---hence, of polar form, Eq (20). Paper refs[35, 36] are of fundamentally needed mathematical formulations on numerical quadratures: those of Radau-Gauss and Hermite-Gauss over the half-real axis.},

This paper proposes a two-dimensional multispeed thermal model for the finite-difference lattice Boltzmann method ($FDLBM$).

In the $FDLBM$, particle velocities can be selected independently from the lattice configuration. Therefore, particle velocities of octagonal directions, which have up to seventh rank isotropic tensors, are adopted. The proposed model was verified by two simulations.

This problem is considered in the present paper, following an alternative approach and giving the minimal discrete velocity sets in accordance with the order of approximation that is required for the LBE with respect to the continuous Boltzmann equation and with the lattice structure. Considering $N$ to be the order of the polynomial approximation to the Maxwell-Boltzmann equilibrium distribution, it is shown that solving the discretization problem is equivalent to finding the inner product in the discrete space induced by the inner product in the continuous space that preserves the norm and the orthogonality of the Hermite polynomial tensors in the Hilbert space generated by the functions that map the velocity space onto the real numbers space. As a consequence, it is shown that, for each order $N$ of approximation, the even-parity velocity tensors are isotropic up to rank $2N$ in the discrete space. The norm and the orthogonality restrictions lead to space-filling lattices with increased dimensionality when compared with presently known lattices. This problem is discussed in relation with a discretization approach based on a finite set of orthogonal functions in the discrete space. Two-dimensional square lattices intended to be used in thermal problems and their respective equilibrium distributions are presented and discussed.},

In addition, theoretical indications to the order of accuracy requirements are given for each discrete approximation, for thermohydrodynamic systems, and for fluid systems involving long-range interactions. All these are important for complex and micro-scale flows and are missing in the conventional Navier–Stokes order descriptions.

  abstract  = {In this work is shown a formal and systematic derivation procedure of a set of differential equations, in space $(x; t)$, from the Boltzmann transport equation, in space $(x; c; t)$, which transfer equations represent properly the thermohydrodynamics of a compressible fluid. For this purpose, the particle distribution function was expanded in a base of the Hilbert space of functions, spanned by the Hermite polynomial tensors of the molecular velocity c, which weight function can be identified as a global Maxwellian distribution function. The truncation order of this series is the one required to obtain the Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations, through the asymptotic Chapman-Enskog analysis. The velocity space was driscretized in order to guarantee that the moments of the approximation to the distribution function can be accurately represented by a quadrature formula. Solutions to the quadrature problem in two and three dimensions, for several approximation orders, were shown and discussed, mainly the relation between the regular cartesian solutions and the Lattice Boltzmann Method $(LBM)$. The solution of the resulting set of partial differential equations of $f_{i}(x; t)$ was accomplished by explicit finite difference method. The method allows for a consistent treatment of the hydrodynamics equations of mixtures of gases with non-homogeneous temperature fields and with different molecular mass components. The procedure was verified by the implementation of a BGK model for simple gases and binary mixtures of gases, with one and three relaxation parameters, respectively. A Chapman-Enskog analysis of the implemented models was developed to obtain the explicit forms of the difusive mass flux, the pressure tensor and the heat flux, and the transport coeficients: binary difusion coefcient, viscosity and thermal conductivity. These results were compared satisfactorily against analytical solutions of the advection-difusion equation with several initial conditions.},

  abstract  = {In this work, we present a derivation for the lattice-Boltzmann equation directly from the linearized Boltzmann equation, combining the following main features: multiple relaxation times and thermodynamic consistency in the description of non isothermal compressible flows. The method presented here is based on the discretization of increasingly orde kinetic models of the Boltzmann equation. Following a Gross-Jackson procedure, the linearized collision term is developed in Hermite polynomial tensors and the resulting infinite series is diagonalized after a chosen integer N, establishing the order of approximation of the collision term. The velocity space is discretized, in accordance with a quadrature method based on prescribed abscissas (Philippi et al., Phys. Rev E 73, 056702, 2006). The problem of describing the energy transfer is discussed, in relation with the order of approximation of a two relaxation-times lattice Boltzmann model. The velocity-step, temperature-step and the shock tube problems are investigated, adopting lattices with 37, 53 and 81 velocities.},

  abstract  = {The velocity discretization is a critical step in deriving the lattice Boltzmann (LBE) from the Boltzmann equation. The velocity discretization problem was considered in a recent paper (Philippi et al., From the continuous to the lattice Boltzmann equation: the discretization problem and thermal models, Physical Review E 73: 56702, 2006) following a new approach and giving the minimal discrete velocity sets in accordance with the order of approximation that is required for the LBE with respect to the Boltzmann equation. As a consequence, two-dimensional lattices and their respective equilibrium distributions were derived and discussed, considering the order of approximation that was required for the LBE. In the present work, a Chapman-Enskog (CE) analysis is performed for deriving the macroscopic transport equations for the mass, momentum and energy for these lattices. The problem of describing the transfer of energy in fluids is discussed in relation with the order of approximation of the LBE model. Simulation of temperature, pressure and velocity steps are also presented to validate the CE analysis.},

  abstract  = {Accuracy of the lattice Boltzmann ($LB$) method for microscale flows with finite Knudsen numbers is investigated. We employ up to the eleventh-order Gauss–Hermite quadrature for the lattice velocities and diffuse-scattering boundary condition for fluid–wall interactions. Detailed comparisons with the direct simulation Monte Carlo ($DSMC$) method and the linearized Boltzmann equation are made for planar Couette and Poiseuille flows. All higher-order $LB$ methods considered here give improved results as compared with the standard $LB$ method. The accuracy of the $LB$ hierarchy, however, does not monotonically increase with the order of the Gauss–Hermite quadrature at moderate and large Knudsen numbers. The results also show the sensitivity to a quadrature chosen, even when the Gauss–Hermite quadratures have the same order of formal accuracy. Among the schemes investigated here, $D2Q16$ is the most efficient method and offers a quantitative prediction in the slip and transition regimes. The higher-order $LB$ methods predict the Knudsen layer up to $K_{n}=O(0.1)$. The Knudsen layer, however, rapidly disappears when the Knudsen number approaches unity due to a finite number of the lattice velocities, while it is still present for $K_{n}=O(1)$ in the Boltzmann equation. It is also found that the higher-order $LB$ methods adopted here do not capture the asymptotic behavior of the Boltzmann equation at large Knudsen numbers.},

  abstract  = {The lattice Boltzmann equation replaces continuous particle velocity space by a finite set; the velocity distribution function then varies over a finite-dimensional vector space instead of over an infinite-dimensional function space. The number of linearly independent moments of the distribution function in a lattice Boltzmann model cannot exceed the number of velocities; finite dimensionality therefore necessarily induces linear dependences among the moments that do not exist in a continuous theory. Given a finite velocity set, it is important to know which moments are free of these dependences. Elementary group theory is applied to the solution of this problem. It is found that decomposing the velocity set into subsets that transform among themselves under an appropriate symmetry group makes it straightforward to uncover linear dependences among the moments. The construction of some standard two- and three-dimensional models is reviewed from this viewpoint, and procedures for constructing higher-dimensional models are suggested.},

Instead of relying on square lattices it is possible to use rectangular and orthorombic lattices as well. Schemes using rectangular lattices can be constructed in several ways. Here we construct a rectangular scheme, with the BGK collision operator, by introducing 2 additional discrete velocities into the standard D2Q9 stencil and show how the same procedure can be applied in three dimensions by extending the D3Q19 stencil. The weights and scaling factors for the new stencils are found as the solutions of the well-known Hermite quadrature problem, assuring isotropy of the lattice tensors up to rank four (Philippi et al., Phys. Rev. E 73(5):056702, 2006) This isotropy is a necessary and sufficient condition for assuring the same second order accuracy of lattice-Boltzmann equation with respect to the Navier–Stokes hydrodynamic equations that is found with the standard D2Q9 and D3Q19 stencils. The numerical validation is done, in the two-dimensional case, by using the new rectangular scheme with D2R11 stencil for simulating the Taylor–Green vortex decay. The D3R23 stencil is numerically validated with three-dimensional simulations of cylindrical sound waves propagating from a point source.},

Examples of such complex dynamics are multiphase and multicomponent flows for which several LB models have already been proposed. However, due to theoretical or numerical reasons, some of these models may require application of high-order lattice-Boltzmann equations (LBEs) and stencils. Here, we will present a derivation of LBEs from the discrete-velocity Boltzmann equation (DVBE). By using the method of characteristics, high-order accurate equations are conveniently formulated with standard numerical methods for ordinary differential equations (ODEs). In particular, we will derive implicit LB schemes due to their stability properties. A simple algorithm is presented which enables implementation of the implicit schemes without resorting to, e.g. change of variables. Finally, some numerical experiments with high-order equations and stencils together with two specific multiphase models are presented.},

  abstract  = {Unlike conventional CFD methods, the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) describes the dynamic behaviour of physical systems in a mesoscopic scale, based on discrete forms of kinetic equations. In addition to the classical collision-propagation scheme in which the physical and velocity spaces are coupled, finite-differences, finite volumes and finite-element schemes have been used for numerically solving the discrete kinetic equations. A major breakthrough in LB theory was the direct derivation of the LB equation from continuous kinetic equations, establishing a systematic link between the kinetic theory and the lattice Boltzmann method and determining the necessary conditions for the discretization of the velocity space. The lattices obtained by this method proved to be stable in flows over a wide range of parameters, by the use of high-order lattice Boltzmann schemes, leading to velocity sets which, when used in a discrete velocity kinetic scheme, ensures accurate recovery of the high-order hydrodynamic moments. This review presents the theoretical background of these kinetic methods. In particular, we focus on high-order discrete forms of the Boltzmann equation suitable for non-ideal fluids and on the lattice-Boltzmann collision-propagation method.},

The cellular automata are discrete analogues of molecular dynamics, in which particles with discrete velocities populate the links of a fixed array of sites.

Slightly modified Navier-Stokes equations are obtained in two and three dimensions with certain lattices.

It is here shown for a class of D-dimensional lattice gas models how the macrodynamical (large-scale) equations for the densities of microscopically conserved quantities can be systematically derived from the underlying exact "microdynamical" Boolean equations. With suitable restrictions on the crystallographic symmetries of the lattice and after proper limits are taken, various standard fluid dynamical equations are obtained, including the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in two and three dimensions. The transport coefficients appearing in the macrodynamical equations are obtained using variants of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem and Boltzmann formalisms adapted to fully discrete situations.},

The simplicity of formulation and its versatility explain the rapid expansion of the $LB$ method to applications in complex and multiscale flows.We review many significant developments over the past decade with specific examples. Some of the most active developments include the entropic $LB$ method and the application of the $LB$ method to turbulent flow, multiphase flow, and deformable particle and fiber suspensions. Hybrid methods based on the combination of the Eulerian lattice with a Lagrangian grid system for the simulation of moving deformable boundaries show promise for more efficient applications to a broader class of problems.We also discuss higherorder boundary conditions and the simulation of microchannel flow with finite Knudsen number. Additionally, the remarkable scalability of the $LB$ method for parallel processing is shown with examples. Teraflop simulations with the $LB$ method are routine, and there is no doubt that this method will be one of the first candidates for petaflop computational fluid dynamics in the near future.},

  abstract  = {In order to simulate the fully compressible thermohydrodynamical flows using the Boltzmann equation, much of the attention has to be paid in the process of the discretization of the velocity space. Hence, the physical connection between the lattice-Boltzmann equation and its continuous counterpart is taken into account and a procedure is formally derived. The velocity discretization is performed through a quadrature process, where the discrete norm of the tensor Hermite polynomials of the given order of approximation is made equal to the continuous norm of the Hermite polynomials in the Hilbert space. The method, named prescribed abscissas quadrature, allows one to locate the poles of integration leading to exact streaming schemes, an important attribute of the lattice-Boltzmann method. Using this prescribed abscissas quadrature, conventional lattice-Boltzmann models, such as $D1Q3$, $D2Q7$, $D2Q9$, $D3Q15$, $D3Q19$ and $D3Q27$ are obtained, and also lattices of higher orders for one, two and three dimensions. Instead of using a posteriori techniques to match coefficients in an expanded equilibrium distribution function, the Maxwellian distribution function is approximated according to a chosen order. A linear stability analysis is applied and shows the better performance of the proposed method when confronted to other methods.},

  abstract  = {Unlike conventional computational fluid dynamics methods, the lattice Boltzmann method ($LBM$) describes the dynamic behavior of fluids in a mesoscopic scale based on discrete forms of kinetic equations. In this scale, complex macroscopic phenomena like the formation and collapse of interfaces can be naturally described as related to source terms incorporated into the kinetic equations. In this context, a novel athermal lattice Boltzmann scheme for the simulation of phase transition is proposed. The continuous kinetic model obtained from the Liouville equation using themean-field interaction force approach is shown to be consistent with diffuse interface model using the Helmholtz free energy. Density profiles, interface thickness, and surface tension are analytically derived for a plane liquid-vapor interface. A discrete form of the kinetic equation is then obtained by applying the quadrature method based on prescribed abscissas together with a third-order scheme for the discretization of the streaming or advection term in the Boltzmann equation. Spatial derivatives in the source terms are approximated with high-order schemes. The numerical validation of the method is performed by measuring the speed of sound as well as by retrieving the coexistence curve and the interface density profiles. The appearance of spurious currents near the interface is investigated. The simulations are performed with the equations of state of Van der Waals, Redlich-Kwong, Redlich-Kwong-Soave, Peng-Robinson, and Carnahan-Starling.},

  abstract  = {We present a lattice Boltzmann model ($LBM$) that covers the entire range of fluid flows, from low Mach weakly compressible to transonic and supersonic flows. One of the most restrictive limitations of the lattice Boltzmann method, the low Mach number limit, is overcome here by three fundamental changes to the $LBM$ scheme: use of an appropriately chosen multispeed lattice, accurate evaluation of the equilibrium, and the entropic relaxation for the collision. The range of applications is demonstrated through the simulation of a bow shock in front of an airfoil and the simulation of decaying compressible turbulence with shocklets.},

	abstract = {Current approaches to Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) are computationally quite expensive for most realistic scientific and engineering applications of Fluid Dynamics such as automobiles or atmospheric flows. The Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM), with its simplified kinetic descriptions, has emerged as an important tool for simulating hydrodynamics. In a heterogeneous computing environment, it is often preferred due to its flexibility and better parallel scaling. However, direct simulation of realistic applications, without the use of turbulence models, remains a distant dream even with highly efficient methods such as LBM. In LBM, a fictitious lattice with suitable isotropy in the velocity space is considered to recover Navier-Stokes hydrodynamics in macroscopic limit. The same lattice is mapped onto a cartesian grid for spatial discretization of the kinetic equation. In this paper, we present an inverted argument of the LBM, by making spatial discretization as the central theme. We argue that the optimal spatial discretization for LBM is a Body Centered Cubic (BCC) arrangement of grid points. We illustrate an order-of-magnitude gain in efficiency for LBM and thus a significant progress towards feasibility of DNS for realistic flows.},
