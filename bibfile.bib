This approach completely eliminates the statistical noise that plagues the usual lattice-gas simulations and therefore permits simulations that demand much less computer time. It is estimated to be more efficient than the lattice-gas automata for intermediate to low Reynolds number R $\sim$ 100.},

These manipulations lead to macroscopic equations without the nonlinear deviations, from which conventional thermal or nonthermal lattice $BGK$ models suffered. We demonstrate the improvements by conducting classical Chapman-Enskog analysis and by the numerical calculation of the structure of the shock wave front and the decaying rate of the kinetic energy in the shear wave Bow. Parameters in the velocity expansion are explicitly given for example models in one, two, and three dimensions.

  abstract = {In this paper, the lattice Boltzmann equation is directly derived from the Boltzmann equation. It is shown that the lattice Boltzmann equation is a special discretized form of the Boltzmann equation. Various approximations for the discretization of the Boltzmann equation in both time and phase space are discussed in detail. A general procedure to derive the lattice Boltzmann model from the continuous Boltzmann equation is demonstrated explicitly. The lattice Boltzmann models derived include the two-dimensional 6-bit, 7-bit, and 9-bit, and three-dimensional 27-bit models.},
  comment  = {Read on Sun, 2016-03-13. Written on a time in which lattice Boltzmann methods, LBM, were mainly, if not only, derived from lattice gas automata, LGA, the article presents the derivation of the lattice-Boltzmann equation, LBE, directly from the continuous Boltzmann equation with the approximation of linearization of the collision operator and the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook, BGK, approximation with a single relaxation time. The article sheds light on the reasons why the method had not enjoyed success in simulating thermohydrodynamic systems before, refs [19--22], and afirms that the SRT BGK approximation is ``sufficient for the purpose of studying hydrodynamics of simple fluids''. It provides a clear, accessible, step-by-step presentation of the discretization of the Boltzmann equation, covering the following requirements: continuous Boltzmann equation without body/external-force term and velocity moments of the single-particle PDF, Section II; discretization in time, Section II-a, calculation of hydrodynamic moments from the discretized data, Section II-b; derivation of the LBE and its EDF, along with its ingredients, Section III; low-Mach number approximation of the EDF, Section III-a; discretization of phase space, Section III-b. In Section IV, some well-known, low order LBE models, such as the D2Q6, D2Q7, D2Q9, and D3Q27, are derived. Some unknown methods are cited, such as the Radau-Gauss numerical integration formula from ref. [35], after which the reading becomes way less clear. The following discussion is confused, as a so-called gas ``speed of light'' and ``speed of sound'' are mentioned, as well as the weights $w_a$ are simply presented, without further explanation. There are $W_a$ and $w_a$ weights in the text. Excellent material to base a presentation of up the the LBE equation, without applying it to a particular lattice configuration. This paper confirms that the integral of vector d\xi expands into multiple (=# of dimensions) integrals of velocity direction and magnitude---hence, of polar form, Eq (20). Paper refs[35, 36] are of fundamentally needed mathematical formulations on numerical quadratures: those of Radau-Gauss and Hermite-Gauss over the half-real axis.},

This problem is considered in the present paper, following an alternative approach and giving the minimal discrete velocity sets in accordance with the order of approximation that is required for the LBE with respect to the continuous Boltzmann equation and with the lattice structure. Considering $N$ to be the order of the polynomial approximation to the Maxwell-Boltzmann equilibrium distribution, it is shown that solving the discretization problem is equivalent to finding the inner product in the discrete space induced by the inner product in the continuous space that preserves the norm and the orthogonality of the Hermite polynomial tensors in the Hilbert space generated by the functions that map the velocity space onto the real numbers space. As a consequence, it is shown that, for each order $N$ of approximation, the even-parity velocity tensors are isotropic up to rank $2N$ in the discrete space. The norm and the orthogonality restrictions lead to space-filling lattices with increased dimensionality when compared with presently known lattices. This problem is discussed in relation with a discretization approach based on a finite set of orthogonal functions in the discrete space. Two-dimensional square lattices intended to be used in thermal problems and their respective equilibrium distributions are presented and discussed.},

  abstract = {In this work is shown a formal and systematic derivation procedure of a set of differential equations, in space $(x; t)$, from the Boltzmann transport equation, in space $(x; c; t)$, which transfer equations represent properly the thermohydrodynamics of a compressible fluid. For this purpose, the particle distribution function was expanded in a base of the Hilbert space of functions, spanned by the Hermite polynomial tensors of the molecular velocity c, which weight function can be identified as a global Maxwellian distribution function. The truncation order of this series is the one required to obtain the Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations, through the asymptotic Chapman-Enskog analysis. The velocity space was driscretized in order to guarantee that the moments of the approximation to the distribution function can be accurately represented by a quadrature formula. Solutions to the quadrature problem in two and three dimensions, for several approximation orders, were shown and discussed, mainly the relation between the regular cartesian solutions and the Lattice Boltzmann Method $(LBM)$. The solution of the resulting set of partial differential equations of $f_{i}(x; t)$ was accomplished by explicit finite difference method. The method allows for a consistent treatment of the hydrodynamics equations of mixtures of gases with non-homogeneous temperature fields and with different molecular mass components. The procedure was verified by the implementation of a BGK model for simple gases and binary mixtures of gases, with one and three relaxation parameters, respectively. A Chapman-Enskog analysis of the implemented models was developed to obtain the explicit forms of the difusive mass flux, the pressure tensor and the heat flux, and the transport coeficients: binary difusion coefcient, viscosity and thermal conductivity. These results were compared satisfactorily against analytical solutions of the advection-difusion equation with several initial conditions.},

Yan et al. and Kataoka et al. clarified the conditions for deriving models with arbitrary specific heat ratio and proposed Euler models.

In this paper, a two-dimensional $FDLBM$ Navier Stokes model and a three-dimensional $FDLBM$ Euler model, which allow arbitrary values to be set for the specific heat ratio, were proposed. These models stably performed numerical simulations from subsonic to supersonic ranges.},

  abstract  = {Accuracy of the lattice Boltzmann ($LB$) method for microscale flows with finite Knudsen numbers is investigated. We employ up to the eleventh-order Gauss–Hermite quadrature for the lattice velocities and diffuse-scattering boundary condition for fluid–wall interactions. Detailed comparisons with the direct simulation Monte Carlo ($DSMC$) method and the linearized Boltzmann equation are made for planar Couette and Poiseuille flows. All higher-order $LB$ methods considered here give improved results as compared with the standard $LB$ method. The accuracy of the $LB$ hierarchy, however, does not monotonically increase with the order of the Gauss–Hermite quadrature at moderate and large Knudsen numbers. The results also show the sensitivity to a quadrature chosen, even when the Gauss–Hermite quadratures have the same order of formal accuracy. Among the schemes investigated here, $D2Q16$ is the most efficient method and offers a quantitative prediction in the slip and transition regimes. The higher-order $LB$ methods predict the Knudsen layer up to $K_{n}=O(0.1)$. The Knudsen layer, however, rapidly disappears when the Knudsen number approaches unity due to a finite number of the lattice velocities, while it is still present for $K_{n}=O(1)$ in the Boltzmann equation. It is also found that the higher-order $LB$ methods adopted here do not capture the asymptotic behavior of the Boltzmann equation at large Knudsen numbers.},

  abstract  = {The lattice Boltzmann equation replaces continuous particle velocity space by a finite set; the velocity distribution function then varies over a finite-dimensional vector space instead of over an infinite-dimensional function space. The number of linearly independent moments of the distribution function in a lattice Boltzmann model cannot exceed the number of velocities; finite dimensionality therefore necessarily induces linear dependences among the moments that do not exist in a continuous theory. Given a finite velocity set, it is important to know which moments are free of these dependences. Elementary group theory is applied to the solution of this problem. It is found that decomposing the velocity set into subsets that transform among themselves under an appropriate symmetry group makes it straightforward to uncover linear dependences among the moments. The construction of some standard two- and three-dimensional models is reviewed from this viewpoint, and procedures for constructing higher-dimensional models are suggested.},

The simplicity of formulation and its versatility explain the rapid expansion of the $LB$ method to applications in complex and multiscale flows. We review many significant developments over the past decade with specific examples. Some of the most active developments include the entropic $LB$ method and the application of the $LB$ method to turbulent flow, multiphase flow, and deformable particle and fiber suspensions. Hybrid methods based on the combination of the Eulerian lattice with a Lagrangian grid system for the simulation of moving deformable boundaries show promise for more efficient applications to a broader class of problems. We also discuss higherorder boundary conditions and the simulation of microchannel flow with finite Knudsen number. Additionally, the remarkable scalability of the $LB$ method for parallel processing is shown with examples. Teraflop simulations with the $LB$ method are routine, and there is no doubt that this method will be one of the first candidates for petaflop computational fluid dynamics in the near future.},

  abstract = {In order to simulate the fully compressible thermohydrodynamical flows using the Boltzmann equation, much of the attention has to be paid in the process of the discretization of the velocity space. Hence, the physical connection between the lattice-Boltzmann equation and its continuous counterpart is taken into account and a procedure is formally derived. The velocity discretization is performed through a quadrature process, where the discrete norm of the tensor Hermite polynomials of the given order of approximation is made equal to the continuous norm of the Hermite polynomials in the Hilbert space. The method, named prescribed abscissas quadrature, allows one to locate the poles of integration leading to exact streaming schemes, an important attribute of the lattice-Boltzmann method. Using this prescribed abscissas quadrature, conventional lattice-Boltzmann models, such as $D1Q3$, $D2Q7$, $D2Q9$, $D3Q15$, $D3Q19$ and $D3Q27$ are obtained, and also lattices of higher orders for one, two and three dimensions. Instead of using a posteriori techniques to match coefficients in an expanded equilibrium distribution function, the Maxwellian distribution function is approximated according to a chosen order. A linear stability analysis is applied and shows the better performance of the proposed method when confronted to other methods.},

Instead of relying on square lattices it is possible to use rectangular and orthorombic lattices as well. Schemes using rectangular lattices can be constructed in several ways. Here we construct a rectangular scheme, with the BGK collision operator, by introducing 2 additional discrete velocities into the standard D2Q9 stencil and show how the same procedure can be applied in three dimensions by extending the D3Q19 stencil. The weights and scaling factors for the new stencils are found as the solutions of the well-known Hermite quadrature problem, assuring isotropy of the lattice tensors up to rank four (Philippi et al., Phys. Rev. E 73(5):056702, 2006) This isotropy is a necessary and sufficient condition for assuring the same second order accuracy of lattice-Boltzmann equation with respect to the Navier–Stokes hydrodynamic equations that is found with the standard D2Q9 and D3Q19 stencils. The numerical validation is done, in the two-dimensional case, by using the new rectangular scheme with D2R11 stencil for simulating the Taylor–Green vortex decay. The D3R23 stencil is numerically validated with three-dimensional simulations of cylindrical sound waves propagating from a point source.},

By using the method of characteristics, high-order accurate equations are conveniently formulated with standard numerical methods for ordinary differential equations (ODEs). In particular, we will derive implicit LB schemes due to their stability properties. A simple algorithm is presented which enables implementation of the implicit schemes without resorting to, e.g. change of variables.

  abstract  = {Unlike conventional computational fluid dynamics methods, the lattice Boltzmann method ($LBM$) describes the dynamic behavior of fluids in a mesoscopic scale based on discrete forms of kinetic equations. In this scale, complex macroscopic phenomena like the formation and collapse of interfaces can be naturally described as related to source terms incorporated into the kinetic equations. In this context, a novel athermal lattice Boltzmann scheme for the simulation of phase transition is proposed. The continuous kinetic model obtained from the Liouville equation using themean-field interaction force approach is shown to be consistent with diffuse interface model using the Helmholtz free energy. Density profiles, interface thickness, and surface tension are analytically derived for a plane liquid-vapor interface. A discrete form of the kinetic equation is then obtained by applying the quadrature method based on prescribed abscissas together with a third-order scheme for the discretization of the streaming or advection term in the Boltzmann equation. Spatial derivatives in the source terms are approximated with high-order schemes. The numerical validation of the method is performed by measuring the speed of sound as well as by retrieving the coexistence curve and the interface density profiles. The appearance of spurious currents near the interface is investigated. The simulations are performed with the equations of state of Van der Waals, Redlich-Kwong, Redlich-Kwong-Soave, Peng-Robinson, and Carnahan-Starling.},

One of the most restrictive limitations of the lattice Boltzmann method, the low Mach number limit, is overcome here by three fundamental changes to the $LBM$ scheme: use of an appropriately chosen multispeed lattice, accurate evaluation of the equilibrium, and the entropic relaxation for the collision. The range of applications is demonstrated through the simulation of a bow shock in front of an airfoil and the simulation of decaying compressible turbulence with shocklets.},

  abstract = {The lattice Boltzmann methods, LBM, are a set of numerical methods for simulation of transport phenomena which may be based in the discretization of Boltzmann equation, which governs evolution of probability distribution function of single particle, in terms of microscopic velocities and position in the time. Lattice Boltzmann methods uses spacial lattices whose nodes $\{x_j\}$ represents the set of discrete positions associate to a finite set of microscopic discrete velocities $\{\xi_j\}$ and their respective probabilities $f(x_j, \xi_j)$. In general, the greater the number $j$ of microscopic discrete velocities for each localization $x_j$ the higher the order of approximation of $f(x_j, \xi_j)$. Since primary macroscopics quantities and their respective derivatives are obtained by crescent order moments of f in the velocities space, in the lattice Boltzmann methods microscopic, discrete velocities assembly refinaments lead to solution of more physics by numerical scheme. This feature, without equivalent in methods based on macroscopic formulations of transport phenomena motivates the acquisition and exploration of various methods of lattice Boltzmann based on lattices of different configurations. The proposed research aims to investigate the systematic Philippi et al. (2006) to bypass stencils lattice Boltzmann for a given space reticulum and its associated speeds through the discretization of the Boltzmann equation using Hermite projections bases. These stencils are sets of quadrature weights, speed of sound, speed scale and speed of the lattice lattice Boltzmann own and uses it as an input parameter in the methods of lattice Boltzmann. As accuracy requirement in the advection, which aims avoid numerical diffusion in the simulation results, the velocities should exactly fit in a lattice n dimensional with b velocities, so, all velocities should be a linear combination of integer coefficients other. Once validated, aims with the systematic derive higher order lattice Boltzmann methods. The systematic validation It occurred through comparisions with low and medium order methods found in the literature.},

  abstract      = {Current approaches to Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) are computationally quite expensive for most realistic scientific and engineering applications of Fluid Dynamics such as automobiles or atmospheric flows. The Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM), with its simplified kinetic descriptions, has emerged as an important tool for simulating hydrodynamics. In a heterogeneous computing environment, it is often preferred due to its flexibility and better parallel scaling. However, direct simulation of realistic applications, without the use of turbulence models, remains a distant dream even with highly efficient methods such as LBM. In LBM, a fictitious lattice with suitable isotropy in the velocity space is considered to recover Navier-Stokes hydrodynamics in macroscopic limit. The same lattice is mapped onto a cartesian grid for spatial discretization of the kinetic equation. In this paper, we present an inverted argument of the LBM, by making spatial discretization as the central theme. We argue that the optimal spatial discretization for LBM is a Body Centered Cubic (BCC) arrangement of grid points. We illustrate an order-of-magnitude gain in efficiency for LBM and thus a significant progress towards feasibility of DNS for realistic flows.},

In addition to the classical collision-propagation scheme in which the physical and velocity spaces are coupled, finite-differences, finite volumes and finite-element schemes have been used for numerically solving the discrete kinetic equations. A major breakthrough in LB theory was the direct derivation of the LB equation from continuous kinetic equations, establishing a systematic link between the kinetic theory and the lattice Boltzmann method and determining the necessary conditions for the discretization of the velocity space. The lattices obtained by this method proved to be stable in flows over a wide range of parameters, by the use of high-order lattice Boltzmann schemes, leading to velocity sets which, when used in a discrete velocity kinetic scheme, ensures accurate recovery of the high-order hydrodynamic moments. This review presents the theoretical background of these kinetic methods. In particular, we focus on high-order discrete forms of the Boltzmann equation suitable for non-ideal fluids and on the lattice-Boltzmann collision-propagation method.},

  abstract  = {A comparison study between the two most popular lattice Boltzmann ($LB$) models – $D2Q5$ and $D2Q9$ in two dimensions with five and nine discrete lattice velocities, respectively – for the convection-diffusion equation ($CDE$) for scalar transport is presented in this work. The local equilibria in both the discrete velocity space and the moment space are provided for the $LB$ models examined, including the generalized $D2Q5$ model without high-order velocity terms and four various $D2Q9$ models frequently used in the literature. The boundary condition treatment is discussed with particular Dirichlet and Neumann boundary schemes presented for each $LB$ model. In particular, the non-uniqueness in the splitting of the normal flux into three lattice directions in $D2Q9$ model for Neumann conditions is highlighted. Five representative numerical tests are presented to assess the performance of the $D2Q5$ and $D2Q9$ $LB$ models. Performance metrics include the numerical accuracy and convergence orders of the interior distribution of the scalar variable $\phi$ and its derivatives as well as the boundary flux, boundary scalar values, and total boundary heat/mass transfer rate. The results demonstrate that (i) without the boundary effect, both the $D2Q5$ and $D2Q9$ models have second-order convergence for $\phi$ and its derivatives, and the $D2Q5$ model has smaller numerical errors at low and moderate P\'eclet numbers while the $D2Q9$ models have better accuracy at high P\'eclet numbers; (ii) for the $CDE$ with specific boundary conditions on straight walls, the $D2Q5$ model with the interpolation based boundary schemes is able to preserve the second-order accuracy for all the quantities of interest for both Dirichlet and Neumann problems; when the $D2Q9$ models are applied, these boundary schemes result in second- and first-order accurate $\phi$ field for the Dirichlet and Neumann problems, respectively; in addition, the convergence orders for the interior derivatives and the boundary flux or boundary values are also degraded for both types of problems; (iii) when curved geometry is encountered, the $D2Q5$ model also shows better accuracy and/or higher convergence orders than the $D2Q9$ models. Clearly, $D2Q5$ is more appealing to $D2Q9$ for the $CDE$ when the convection is not very strong and the boundary effect is significant. The same behavior in the respective $3-D$ numerical solutions is observed when the performance of $D3Q7$ and $D3Q19 $LB$ models are compared.},

The particles are distributed and interact in lattices that discretize a velocity space and a spatial space. The set formed by the weights, discrete velocities and the scale of lattice is called stencil. The velocity space from the continuous equation discretization is a critical step in the Boltzmann stencils derivation. There are diﬀerent ways to conduct it, such that one, prescribed abscissas method, works with a set of predeﬁned dimensionless discrete velocities. The problem, a quadrature for the weights and the lattice scale determination, is equivalent to an internal product tensor between two Hermite tensor polynomials in the discrete space. There is no detailed procedure in the bibliography about how to solve the quadratures, so this work will investigate algorithms to solve them, which lead to the creation of new lattice-Boltzmann methods.},
