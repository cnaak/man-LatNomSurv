\section{Introduction}

    Historically,   the   Lattice-Boltzmann   (LB)    method    had    its    origins    in    the    frame    of    Lattice-Gas
    Automata~\cite{1988-McNamaraGR+ZanettiG-PhysRevLett},     and     has     been     intensely     developed     since     its
    inception~\cite{1992-BenziR+VergassolaM-PhysRep,       1998-ChenS+DoolenGD-AnnuRevFluidMech,        2011-MohamadAA-Springer,
    2018-KrugerT+ViggenEM-Springer}. One important conceptual and implementational parameter  of  LB  methods  is  the  employed
    \emph{lattice    stencil}---understood    as    the    lattice    geometry,    velocity    set,    weights,    and     scale
    parameters~\cite{2013-HegeleJr+PhilippiPC-JSciComput,                                2013-MattilaKK+PhilippiPC-IntJModPhysC,
    2014-MattilaKK+PhilippiPC-SciWorldJ}, although some authors may include  in  the  stencil  designation  additional  modeling
    elements, such as the relaxation time scheme~\cite{2017-LiL+KlausnerJF-IntJHeatMassTran}.

    Both LB and LGA methods can be implemented on a variety of lattices, and historically many such lattices (along  with  their
    corresponding names or naming systems) have been developed. This work presents a LB literature  survey  focused  on  lattice
    naming schemes, or model nomenclature systems, from its Lattice-Gas Automata (LGA)  predecessor  method  until  the  present
    time, in a somewhat chronological timeline.

    \subsection{Lattice-Gas Automata Lattice Designations}

    Some   LGA   lattices   were   named   with   \emph{acronyms}   after   its   first   proposers,   such   as    the    `HPP'
    one~\cite{1986-FrischU+PomeauY-PhysRevLett},  after  Hardy,  de  Pazzis,   and   Pomeau~\cite{1973-HardyJ+PazzisO-JMathPhys,
    1976-HardyJ+PomeauY-PhysRevA,  1987-SucciS-JPhysAMathGen},  or   geometry-based   \emph{acronyms},   such   as   the   `HLG'
    one~\cite{1986-FrischU+PomeauY-PhysRevLett}, which stands for `hexagonal lattice gas,' later on referred  to  as  the  `FHP'
    one~\cite{1987-FrischU+RivetJP-ComplexSyst,  1987-SucciS-JPhysAMathGen},  after  Frisch,  Hasslacher,  and  Pomeau.  Another
    geometry-based  lattice  of  the  time  is  the  `FCHC'  one~\cite{1987-FrischU+RivetJP-ComplexSyst},   which   stands   for
    `face-centered-hypercubic' model, due to d'Humi√®res, Lallemand, and Frisch.

    Later on designations such as `FHP + 3 rest particles' and `FCHC + 3 rest particles' also appeared~\cite{1991-BoonJP-PhysD},
    as   well   as   suffixes   such   as   `-I',   `-III',   and    `-IV'    after    `FHP',    for    alternative    collision
    rules~\cite{1991-AppertC+ZaleskiS-PhysD, 1991-BoonJP-PhysD, 1991-ChenS+RoseH-PhysD}.

    \subsection{Early Lattice-Boltzmann Years}

    \vspace{2.0mm}\noindent\textbf{Inception Period:}\vspace{1.0mm}

    LB   methods   adhered    to    LGA    lattice    nomenclature    in    its    inception    period,    as    witnessed    by
    reference~\cite{1988-McNamaraGR+ZanettiG-PhysRevLett}          in          1988          and          by          subsequent
    references~\cite{1989-HigueraFJ+JimenezJ-EurophysLett,         1989-HigueraFJ+SucciS-EurophysLett}         in          1989,
    by~\cite{1990-BenziR+VergassolaM-EurophysLett,   1990-BenziR+VergassolaM-NuclPhysB,    1990-CancelliereA+SucciS-PhysFluidsA,
    1990-VergassolaM+SucciS-EurophysLett}   in   1990,   and   by~\cite{1991-CornubertR+LevermoreD-PhysD,    1991-ErnstMH-PhysD,
    1991-FrischU-PhysD, 1991-GunstensenAK+ZanettiG-PhysRevA, 1991-SucciS+BenziR-PhysRevA} in 1991, to cite a few.

    \vspace{2.0mm}\noindent\textbf{Early 1990's:}\vspace{1.0mm}

    It seems that Qian~\cite{1990-QianYH-Paris} (apud~\cite[p.~235]{1993-QianYH-JSciComput}) was the one to introduce, in  1990,
    the `DdQb' lattice naming scheme for LB methods---in which $d$ is the lattice \emph{Euclidean dimensionality} and $b$ is the
    lattice  \emph{velocity   count},   as   in   D1Q3,   D2Q9,   and   D3Q15,   etc.~\cite{1992-QianYH+LallemandP-EurophysLett,
    1993-QianYH+OrszagSA-EuroPhysLett}---that seems to be the most prevalent lattice naming system  to  date,  although  notable
    exceptions appear long after the paper~\cite{1991-QianYH+LallemandP-AdvKinTheoContMech} came out in 1991.

    As far as increasing lattice velocity counts go, the relationship between mesoscopic lattice \emph{symmetry}  and  resulting
    macroscopic   description   \emph{isotropy}   has   been   established    from    early    in    the    history    of    LGA
    methods~\cite{1973-HardyJ+PazzisO-JMathPhys, 1976-HardyJ+PomeauY-PhysRevA},  in  two~\cite{1986-FrischU+PomeauY-PhysRevLett}
    and  in  three  Euclidean   dimensions,   the   latter   requiring   the   lattice   to   include   links   beyond   nearest
    neighbors~\cite[pp.~473, 490]{1986-WolframS-JStatPhys}, hence particle velocities with unequal magnitudes.

    Moreover, Koelman~\cite{1991-KoelmanJMVA-EurophysLett} had proposed matching discrete velocity moments up to a certain order
    $n$ with the $d$-dimensional continuous Boltzmann distribiution, since only those moments  influence  the  macroscopic  flow
    behaviour; such procedure would yield values for lattice velocity \emph{weights} $W_{\alpha}$---nowadays $w_i$. The proposed
    criteria   were   deemed   more   stringent   than   previously    well-known    symmetry    and    isotropy    requirements
    from~\cite{1986-WolframS-JStatPhys}, since it not only led to an isotropic macroscopic description, but also ensure pressure
    term independence from velocity terms of the Navier-Stokes description. Furthermore, a skewed  rectangular  9-speed  lattice
    with independent $a$ and $b$ axis lengths was proposed\footnote{That lattice was named  `face-centred  rectangular'  by  the
    author.}, whose weights exactly recover those of the well-known D2Q9 lattice for $a = b$, over which the argument that valid
    weights `[...] \emph{can  always  be  found  by  choosing  a  large  enough  set  of}  (lattice)  \emph{velocity  vectors\/}
    [...]'~\cite{1991-KoelmanJMVA-EurophysLett}.

    One    driving    application     for     increased     velocity     count     lattices     is     thermal     flows.     On
    reference~\cite{1993-AlexanderFJ+SterlingJD-PhysRevE} an \emph{unnamed}  2D,  hexagonal  (triangular),  13-velocity  lattice
    having velocity magnitudes of 0,  1,  and  2  lattice  units~\cite{1998-ChenS+DoolenGD-AnnuRevFluidMech}  was  employed  for
    adiabatic sound propagation and heat transfer Couette flow, whose results were shown to be in agreement  with  corresponding
    analytical solutions.

    Some `nDmV' lattices, with $n$ being the Euclidean space dimension and $m$ the lattice velocity count, namely, 1D5V,  2D16V,
    and 3D40V, were introduced in~\cite{1994-ChenY+AkiyamaM-PhysRevE} for  shock  wave  front  structure  and  shear  wave  flow
    application cases. The 2D16V lattice was said to be comprised of four \emph{sublattices}, a term that appeared in subsequent
    references, with each sublattice having 4 discrete velocities of same magnitude and forming adjacent right angles, which led
    to possibly multiple sublattices per lattice energy level $\epsilon \equiv 2e = \xi^2$, with  $\xi$  being  the  microscopic
    (lattice) velocity magnitude, and $e$ the corresponding specific kinetic energy, as was the case with the $\epsilon = 1^2  +
    2^2 = 5$ energy level of a square lattice, represented by the 8 discrete velocities ($\pm\{1,2\}$, $\pm\{2,1\}$) in  lattice
    units. This is in contrast to the seemingly prevailing current view of a multiple-velocity lattice being  a  single  lattice
    entity, without explicit reference to sublattices.

    \vspace{2.0mm}\noindent\textbf{Later 1990's and early 2000's:}\vspace{1.0mm}

    Most likely borrowing from mesh-based CFD methods, a study~\cite{1996-HeX+DemboM-JComputPhys} has proposed  a  LB  algorithm
    for non-uniform mesh grids, by decoupling spatial and momentum space  discretizations  in  the  LB  scheme.  The  underlying
    momentum space discretization was the well-known D2Q9 lattice, referred to in the study as `9-bit BGK model in 2D space' and
    semantic variations thereof, in which BGK  stands  for  Kinetic  theory's  Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook  collision  model  for  the
    continuous Boltzmann equation~\cite{1954-BhatnagarPL+KrookM-PhysRev, 2003-LiboffRL-bookSpringer, 2011-HarrisS-Dover}.

    Nine years after the debut of LB methods, a study~\cite{1997-HeX+LuoLS-PhysRevE} showed that they could be directly  derived
    from    the    continuous    Boltzmann    equation    with    linearized    collision     operator     under     the     BGK
    approximation~\cite{2011-HarrisS-Dover}, while lattice stencils  from  requirements  of  matching  continuous  and  discrete
    velocity moments up to a desired order---a decisive publication,  not  only  in  making  LB  methods  independent  from  its
    historical predecessor LGA, but also to pave the way towards modern methods  for  lattice  weights  determination  from  the
    lattice  velocity  set~\cite{2014-MattilaKK+PhilippiPC-SciWorldJ}.  The  lattices   in~\cite{1997-HeX+LuoLS-PhysRevE}   were
    verbosely referred to as `$d$-dimensional $b$-bit $g$ lattice model', with $d$ being the Euclidean space dimension, $b$  the
    lattice velocity count, and $g$ a geometry term, such as `triangular,' etc.

    A review article by Shen and  Doolen~\cite{1998-ChenS+DoolenGD-AnnuRevFluidMech}  published  a  decade  after  McNamara  and
    Zanetti's premiere LB publication~\cite{1988-McNamaraGR+ZanettiG-PhysRevLett} and seven years after Qian's paper introducing
    the now-prevailing `DdQb' lattice naming scheme~\cite{1991-QianYH+LallemandP-AdvKinTheoContMech}, would still  refer  to  LB
    lattices either with LGA-style or verbose nomenclatures, and to overall LB schemes based on its  collision  term  treatment,
    such    as    `lattice    BGK    (LBGK)'    models.

    Higher-order lattices were proposed  in~\cite{1998-PavloP+VahalaL-PhysRevLett}  for  two-  and  three-dimensional  Euclidean
    spaces. They were referred to as `octagonal grid (17-bit),' and as `3D ``octagonal'' 53-bit' models, respectively, and  were
    isotropic up to the sixth-order. Since octagons are not space-filling, plane-tiling geometries, the proposed  lattices  were
    not of the Bravais type, meaning they impose a decoupling between the spatial and the  momentum  space  discretizations,  as
    with the non-uniform mesh~\cite{1996-HeX+DemboM-JComputPhys}, and the method has to  resort  to  interpolations,  which  was
    later shown to cause spurious numerical diffusion~\cite[p.~429]{2006-ShanX+ChenH-JFluidMech}.

    Other     lattice     namings     of     the     early-     and     mid-2000's     include     verbose,     spelled      out
    ones~\cite{2001-dHumieresD+LallemandP-PhysRevE,   2005-LuXY-IntJModPhysC};   a   `$D_dQ_b$'   variant   of   Qian's   `DdQb'
    scheme~\cite{2003-NourgalievRR+JosephD-IntJMulFlow};     a     `groupI'     to     `groupIV'     regular     2D      polygon
    variant~\cite{2003-WatariM+TsutaharaM-PhysRevE, 2007-WatariM-PhysA}; a `$b$  ($d$D)'  short  designation  for  an  otherwise
    verbose one~\cite{2006-ChikatamarlaSS+KarlinIV-PhysRevLett}; an explicit lattice units velocity list, such as `$\{0, \pm  1,
    \pm 3\}$', in~\cite{2006-ChikatamarlaSS+KarlinIV-PhysRevLett}; a `dodecahedron' and an `icosahedron' ones that were shown to
    be stable for supersonic thermal flows~\cite{2006-WatariM+TsutaharaM-PhysA, 2007-WatariM-PhysA}.

    \subsection{The Year of 2006}

    The year of 2006 is seemingly a landmark for multi-velocity, higher-order LB schemes---and  incidently  for  lattice  naming
    schemes---as evidenced by the appearance of three key publications, namely those of  Shan,~X.,  Yuan,~X.-F.,  and  Chen,~H.,
    \cite{2006-ShanX+ChenH-JFluidMech},   of   Philippi,~P.~C.,   Hegele,~L.~A.,   dos    Santos,~L.~O.~E.    and    Surmas,~R.,
    \cite{2006-PhilippiPC+SurmasR-PhysRevE},        and        of         Chikatamarla,~S.~S.         and         Karlin,~I.~V.,
    \cite{2006-ChikatamarlaSS+KarlinIV-PhysRevLett}.

    \vspace{2.0mm}\noindent\textbf{Shan and Coauthors:}\vspace{1.0mm}

    A  sistematic   discretization   framework   for   the   Boltzmann   equation   was   proposed   by   Shan   and   coauthors
    in~\cite{2006-ShanX+ChenH-JFluidMech}.  From  Kinetic  theory~\cite{2011-HarrisS-Dover,   2003-LiboffRL-bookSpringer},   the
    authors pointed out  that  successive  Chapman-Enskog  approximations  of  the  Boltzmann  equation  obtain  the  (i)~Euler,
    (ii)~Navier-Stokes, (iii)~Burnett, and (iv)~high\-er-or\-der macroscopic equations---meaning progressively  high\-er-or\-der
    moments  of  the  continuous  Boltzmann  equation  express  progressively  high\-er-or\-der  macroscopic  thermohydrodynamic
    descriptions. Moreover, the authors demonstrated that projecting the Boltzmann equation onto order-$N$  truncated  tensorial
    Hermite polynomial expansion bases~\cite{1949-GradH-CommPureApplMath}, lead to discrete LB models of corresponding order-$N$
    moments, since resulting Hermite expansion coefficients correspond to the velocity moments up to the chosen order.

    In these author's discretization framework, the lattice is viewed as a Hermite expansion \emph{quadrature}, and  the  naming
    convention was defined in terms of three parameters, namely, an Euclidean space dimension $D$, a quadrature  velocity  count
    $d$, and an algebraic degree of precision $n$ encoded in an `$E_{D,n}^{d}$' naming scheme---an order-$N$  Hermite  expansion
    requires      a      quadrature      degree      $n      \geqslant      2N$.      Citing      Qian      and       coauthors'
    lattices~\cite{1992-QianYH+LallemandP-EurophysLett}, they established the following comparisons, which were off  only  by  a
    scaling factor: $D2Q9 \propto E_{2,5}^{9}$, $D3Q15 \propto E_{3,5}^{15}$, and $D3Q19 \propto E_{3,5}^{19}$.

    Additionally, they stablished that Gauss-Hermite quadratures of the Boltzmann equation yield LB  models  with  \emph{minimum
    velocity count} for given degree of precision and Euclidean spacial dimension, without, however, the  ability  to  predefine
    (choose) the discrete velocity abscisae,  which  apart  from  special  cases  fails  to  produce  a  space-filling,  Bravais
    lattice---recalling that for LB methods, this means lower memory requirements but decoupled spatial  and  momentum  `meshes'
    that require interpolations, thus introducing artifacts such as spurious numerical diffusion.

    In the Appendix of reference~\cite{2006-ShanX+ChenH-JFluidMech}, the authors include a brief discussion  with  some  missing
    details on deriving quadratures on predefined Cartesian abscissae, which is the main requirement for space-filling,  Bravais
    lattices for non-interpolating, exact advection LB schemes. Results for the space-filling $E_{2,7}^{17}$ and  $E_{3,7}^{39}$
    quadratures were listed among the ones obtained with Gauss-Hermite quadratures.

    % Missing details include (i) how to switch from rank-0 polynomial base to the tensorial Hermite one, (ii) and from scalar
    % argument Œæ to a vectorial ùõè one.

    \vspace{2.0mm}\noindent\textbf{Philippi and Co-authors:}\vspace{1.0mm}

    Tackling the aspects associated in deriving space-filling, Bravais  lattices  aiming  at  sufficiently  high  orders  as  to
    approach thermal hydrodynamic  transport  problems,  Philippi  and  coauthors~\cite{2006-PhilippiPC+SurmasR-PhysRevE}  have
    proposed a new \emph{Method of Prescribed Abscissas\/}, MPA, for obtaining lattice weight values  and  scaling  factor  from
    predefined lattice arrangements.

    Departing from the continuous Boltzmann equation, the derivation of discrete velocity sets, i.e., the lattice  vectors,  was
    considered as a quadrature problem, in the senses that (i)~weights $w_i$ for lattice velocities $\pmb{\xi}_i$ would be found
    so that moments of the discrete equilibrium mass  distribution  function  $f^{eq}_i$  would  exactly  match  its  continuous
    counterpart, and (ii)~to warrant even-ranked velocity tensor isotropy, which,  in  turn,  translates  into  isotropic  fluid
    transport properties. In the process, authors derived, according to their Eq.~\{6\}, that \emph{lattice velocity weights are
    functions of velocity magnitudes}; hence, of lattice energy levels. This outcome is central to  the  lattice  naming  scheme
    herein proposed.

    In their prescribed abscissas quadrature discussion, authors state that~\cite[p.~6]{2006-PhilippiPC+SurmasR-PhysRevE}:
    %
    \begin{quote}
        \swshape
        ``[...]~$N$th-order approximation to the [Maxwell-Boltzmann]  equilibrium  distribution  is  required  when  $N$th-order
        macroscopic equilibrium moments are to be correctly described in [lattice-Boltzmann methods,]''
    \end{quote}
    %
    \noindent which is homologous to many Shan and coauthor's statements~\cite{2006-ShanX+ChenH-JFluidMech}. Observations  like
    these, allied to the new and consistent methods  of  deriving  higher-order  LB  stencils  by  Gauss-Hermite  or  Prescribed
    Abscissas quadratures, allowed for the immediate  and  subsequent  appearance  of  many-velocity  lattices  in  2D-  and  in
    3D-Euclidean spaces, many of which requiring changes or adaptations in the naming scheme, as the sequence will show.

    Immediate examples~\cite{2006-PhilippiPC+SurmasR-PhysRevE} include (i)~\emph{two} forms of bidimensional, 17-velocity  ones,
    named D2Q17 and D2V17; (ii)~a D2Q21 one; as well  as  (iii)~\emph{two}  forms  of  bidimensional,  25-velocity  ones,  named
    D2V25(W1) and D2V25(W6), containing the energy levels $\epsilon \in \{0, 2, 4, 8, 9, 16, 18\}$, and $\epsilon \in \{0, 1, 2,
    4, 8, 9, 16\}$, respectively---thus without weights labeled `1' and `6'---and  (iv)~a  fourth-order  Hermite  ($N=4$)  D2V37
    lattice, suitable for thermal flow LB simulations.

    \vspace{2.0mm}\noindent\textbf{Chikatamarla and Karlin:}\vspace{1.0mm}

    Seeking  to  systematically   derive   \emph{stable}   and   \emph{Galilean   invariant}   LB   models,   Chikatamarla   and
    Karlin~\cite{2006-ChikatamarlaSS+KarlinIV-PhysRevLett} set about the problem of LB stencil construction from a discrete form
    of Boltzmann's H-theorem---in which the  $(-H)$  quantity  represents  a  sort  of  generalized  thermodynamic  entropy  for
    non-equilibrium states in the Boltzmann Gas Limit (BGL) that increases according to the second law of  thermodynamics  until
    equilibrium is reached~\cite{2011-HarrisS-Dover}. By maximizing the entropy, i.e., by minimizing $H$,
    %
    \begin{equation}
        H = \sum_{i=1}^{N}f_i\ln\left(\frac{f_i}{w_i}\right),
    \end{equation}
    %
    \noindent with appropriately chosen weights $w_i$ under a set of macroscopic constraints of mass and energy conservation  as
    well as constitutive relations for higher-order macroscopic tensors, authors arrived at \emph{explicit} expressions for  the
    weights $w_i$ and for the stencil reference temperature for several one-dimensional  lattice  models  having  from  3  to  5
    velocities. Methods obtained by this systematic were named `entropic' LB methods (ELBM).

    Remarkably, due to a pattern in Gauss-Hermite  quadrature~\cite{2003-AnsumaliS+OettingerHC-EuroPhysLett},  Chikatamarla  and
    Karlin       proposed       a       straightforward       way       of       obtaining       higher-dimension        lattice
    stencils~\cite{2006-ChikatamarlaSS+KarlinIV-PhysRevLett}:

    \begin{quote}
        \swshape
        ``[...]~discrete velocities [$\pmb{\xi}_i$] in the $D$-dimensional case  are  tensor  products  of  $D$  copies  of  the
        one-dimensional velocities, whereas the corresponding weights  [$w_i$]  are  algebraic  products  of  the  corresponding
        weights in one dimension.''
    \end{quote}

    As the immediate examples of~\cite{2006-PhilippiPC+SurmasR-PhysRevE} evidence, as soon as one allows for  including  several
    energy levels (but not necessarily all, nor in monotonic order) in a Bravais lattice,  velocity  count  no  longer  uniquely
    identifies lattices, and thus, \emph{velocity count-based lattice naming schemes are  bound  to  be  ambiguous  and  require
    additional information as to uniquely identify the lattice.\/} Usually, the additional information is laying out  \emph{all}
    velocity vectors, whether by energy level listings, a quiver-like lattice picture,  or  tabulated  lattice  velocities  (and
    weights)---all of which seem, to varying degrees, excessively wordy and lengthy.  Moreover,  the  very  need  for  providing
    additional information as to uniquely identify an already named lattice seems to defeat the purpose of naming them, at least
    partly.
